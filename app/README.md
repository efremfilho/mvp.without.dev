### [Mobile web app example](https://lgbe.universidadeagora.com/app?ref=mvp.without.dev) 
    
## 0 - Understand the Glide Apps

Go to [Glide Apps](https://go.glideapps.com/) and familiarize yourself with the menus - left and right. Try with some template.

## 1 - Create the data structure

First of all, it helps a lot if we think of this as a database. Normally every tab is one entity - think as all the data with the same columns - and you can build filtered versions in separated tabs. 

## 2 - Create the input forms

You can use the Glide Apps' "add" feature. If you need beyond this input, try to use Jotform and [URL parameters](https://www.jotform.com/help/71-Prepopulating-Fields-to-Your-JotForm-via-URL-Parameters), so you can identify the person input the data.

## 3 - Create the app

Now it's time to play with Glide Apps **and iterate over these steps!** Try to build from scratch - to solve your job to be done - and play with the templates.

# Q&A
Now is your time - **2 min** to explain the JOB TO BE DONE
